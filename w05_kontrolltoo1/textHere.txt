Computer programming is an enormously flexible tool that you can use to do amazing things that are otherwise either manual and laborsome or are just impossible.
 If you are using a smartphone, a chat app or if you are unlocking your car with the push of a button,

  You are already immersed in the programs of different types.
   In fact, software is running your life. What if you learn and start running these programs according to your will?
